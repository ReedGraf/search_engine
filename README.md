# 🔍 Search Engine

> ⚠️ This project is in a very primative state 🚧

We're building a search engine!

Just for fun, to learn about how web crawling, tokenizing, databases, server hardware, all that works in a real project.

Just to build something cool

Todo:

- [ ] - Frontend
- [x] - Tokenizers
- [x] - Scoring
- [ ] - Web crawling
- [ ] - Come up with a name
- [ ] - Make crawlers all reference a private ip for the sql server so it doesn't have to travel over the internet

Cool features to add:

- [ ] - Build a ml model or something else to determine whether a page was generated by AI and exclude or flag that result in the search
- [ ] - Build a dashboard to see how many sotes/pages have been crawled, how much is stored in the database, how many links have been foloowed, etc.
- [ ] - Add the ability for users to choose the weights for bigrams/trigrams/prefixes/etc, choose how the algorithm works for themselves
- [ ] - Add Listicles like Kagi does
- [ ] - Add blocklists (disinformation domains, marketing domains, gambling domains, malware domains) for users to set to block or a warning when a result is in the search result
- [ ] - Add support for regex
- [ ] - Add duckuckgo bangs

Indexes to index:

- Kagi list of small blogs (these are rss files, need to parse those) - https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/blob/main/smallweb.txt
- DNS records of all URLs
